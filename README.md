# Device Details

Basically my [Location Details](https://valiantwind.github.io/Location-Details) website except it shows your Device and Browser Details

Although I try to make the information as accurate as possible, all information is not guaranteed to be accurate.

This website is not necessesarily meant to have strong use cases. I am just exploring my abilities to see what's possible. I'm entirely self-taught, and making websites like this is one of the many methods I use to gather programming experience.

## I do NOT store your Device Details. They are only shown

If you want proof of this, see my [API Repository](https://github.com/ValiantWind/api) for the source code of the endpoints used for the website.
